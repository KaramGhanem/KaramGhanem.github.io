  <mark>Update May 2025</mark>: I am looking for work at the intersection of AI research and impact-focused engineering, where I can apply my experience in conversational agents, large language models, and cognitively-informed machine learning to build systems that are not only intelligent, but responsible, transparent, and human-aligned.<br><br>
  
  <mark>About me</mark>:  I work on building AI systems that are aligned with human goals, values, and social contexts has been a central theme of my graduate work and industry research. I’ve led efforts across academia and industry on large language model fine-tuning, agentic architectures, and medical AI. My work emphasizes practical alignment, designing AI that adapts to human intent and context, while contributing to robust technical foundations including reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), self-critique, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and multimodal representation learning. I’m especially interested in how humans interact with intelligent systems, and how design choices shape trust, usability, and social dynamics in real-world settings.
  I recently completed a Master’s of Engineering (Thesis) at Mila Quebec AI Institute & McGill University, where I focused on applying generative models and dimensionality reduction techniques to brain imaging and genomics. I am currently a Senior ML Engineer at Braxted Group, where I design multi-agent conversational systems for immigration services. In my previous role at ServiceNow, I contributed to the development of the TapeAgents framework and advanced large language model fine-tuning pipelines using self-critique strategies and prompt optimization. Previously, I worked in firmware and optical software testing at Infinera (now Nokia), and co-founded an engineering consultancy, bridging software, hardware, and client operations. I also had the opportunity to work on semiconductor and solar cell research under Dr. Ray LaPierre.<br><br>

  <mark>Topics of interest</mark>: Responsible AI, human-AI interaction, multi-agent systems, generative models (diffusion, transformer-based), cognitive modeling, explainability, trust in AI, personalized and goal-driven agents, and applications of AI in health, law, and public systems. <br><br>
  
  <mark>Past Works</mark> LLMs & Agent Architectures: TapeAgents, WebAgents, Form-Filling and Retrieval Agents using LangChain, DSPy, and RLHF pipelines - Biomedical AI: Linking high-dimensional brain imaging and genomics using dimensionality reduction and transformer fine-tuning. <br><br>

  <mark>Currently</mark> Working on a series of projects reflecting on the long-term implications of AI on human identity, cognition, and social systems.

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
